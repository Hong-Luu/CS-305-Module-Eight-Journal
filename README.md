# CS 305 Module Eight Journal

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in personalized financial plans for their clients. They approached Global Rain, our software engineering company, to modernize their operations and enhance the security of their web-based software application. The main issue they wanted us to address was identifying and mitigating any security vulnerabilities in their system. Our task is to conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify potential threats and provide recommendations for strengthening the security of Artemis Financial's software application.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**
When identifying the client's software security vulnerabilities, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of the application, analyzing different layers of the software, such as input validation, secure coding practices, authentication mechanisms, encryption, and secure data handling.
Coding securely is crucial because it helps protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and avoid potential breaches. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by instilling customer trust, safeguarding the company's reputation, mitigating financial losses from cyber attacks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**


**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**


**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**


**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**


**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
